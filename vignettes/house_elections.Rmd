## FEC 

This is a vignette on how to use the FEC package and conduct analysis for questions such as contributions by individuals/special interests for any given election year. Below I will use the 2014 data to address the following questions:
  
  1. How much money did each State raise?

  2. How much money in aggregate did both parties raise in the 2014 midterm election?
  
  3. How much money was contributed from people to pacs for each committee?

##Connect to a local or remote database 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(fec)
library(etl)
library(RMySQL)
```

```{r message=FALSE}
db <- src_mysql(dbname = "fec", user = "root", host = "localhost")
fec <- etl("fec", db)
```

##ETL
  - Doing it all at once
```{r message=FALSE, warning= FALSE}
#fec %>% 
#  etl_create()
```

- Note: For more information on how the ETL Framework works step by step, go to         https://github.com/beanumber/etl#etl

##Analysis
1. How much money did each State raise?
```{r}
fec %>%
  tbl("individuals") %>%
  select(state,transaction_amt) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(transaction_amt)) %>%
collect()
```

- Note: There were an additional 8 classifications under the 'state' column. 

2. How much money in aggregate did both parties raise the 2014 midterm election?

```{r}
committees <- fec %>% tbl("committees")
individuals <- fec %>% tbl("individuals")
Full_Table <- dplyr::full_join(committees, individuals, by = "cmte_id")
amtRaised <- Full_Table %>%
  select(cmte_party_affiliation, transaction_amt) %>%
  group_by(cmte_party_affiliation) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(transaction_amt)) %>%
  filter(cmte_party_affiliation %in% c("REP", "DEM"))
amtRaised
```

3. How much money was contributed from people to pacs for each committee?

```{r results="hide"}
fec %>%
  tbl("people_to_pacs") %>%
  select(party,cmte_name, as.double(total_raised)) %>%
  group_by(party) %>%
  filter(party %in% c("REP", "DEM"))
```

```{r}
## Source:   query [?? x 3]
## Database: mysql  [@Localhost via UNIX socket:/]
## Groups: party
